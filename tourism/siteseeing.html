        <h3>Corcovado</h3>
      <p id="corcovado-info"> Reach the top of the picturesque Corcovado mountain by a modern Swiss-made cogwheel
        rail. As it climbs through Tijuca Rain Forest to the top of the mountain (710 meters), the cogwheel takes about
        17 minutes. <br /><br />
        As you stand above Rio and take in the spectacular views of the beaches of Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon,
        the Lagoon, and Sugarloaf, be sure to turn around and see the statue of Christ the Redeemer, carved in mosaic in the art
        nouveau style, towering 38 meters above you. His symbolically open arms embrace viewers from afar as he reaches out to
        the city that he oversees from above. <br /><br/>

      <h3>Copacabana</h3>
      <p id="copacabana-info">Copacabana beach is one of the most famous on the planet,
         and the iconic, waved boardwalk design, tiny bikinis and striking landscape make for the
         classic Rio beach experience. Its middle section, from postos (lifeguard towers) three to six,
         is where the sand is widest but the waves are at their wildest. <br/><br/>
         Dotted with kiosks every few hundred metres,
         there is no shortage of places to grab a beer or snack, and the tireless beach hawkers do their bit to keep
        everyone refreshed, too. The best place to pitch up is towards posto six: here, the waters are calmer so more
        conducive to swimming, paddleboard schools offer drop-in classes, and the view back along the beach is outstanding. <br />

      <h3>Catch a Football match at Maracan&atilde; Stadium</h3>
      <p id="maracana-info">The undisputed home of Brazilian football, the bowl-shaped
        Maracan&atilde; stadium was also the site of its greatest on-field disaster: defeat to
        Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup Final.
        <br/><br/>
        Revamped to host the 2014 World Cup, it is now very much
        in the model of the modern, FIFA-standardised, international stadium. The view of the pitch remains wonderfully unobstructed,
        and local teams Flamengo and Fluminense play their home matches here, meaning that from March to
        December there are league games most weeks. For most games tickets can be bought
        at the ground shortly before kick off, though buying in advance is recommended (however, some seats are cash only).<br/>
